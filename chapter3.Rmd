```{r}

#Read the joined student alcohol consumption data into R either from your local folder
Here is some code
```{r}
# access the dplyr library
library(dplyr)
alc<-read.csv(file = "data/alc.csv")
glimpse(alc)
```

#From this table,we can see there are 382 rows and 35 columns
#Print out the names of the variables in the data
```{r}
colnames(alc)
```

#Those are the names of the variables,we can choose "high_use" as a target varible and other 4 interesting variables in the data and for each of them, present hypothesis about their relationships with alcohol consumption.
