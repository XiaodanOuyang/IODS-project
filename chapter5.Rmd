*1.Show a graphical overview of the data and show summaries of the variables in the data.*
```{r}
human<-read.csv(file = "data/human.csv")
library(GGally)
ggpairs(human,cardinality_threshold=155)

```

*2.Perform principal component analysis (PCA) on the not standardized human data. Show the variability captured by the principal components. Draw a biplot displaying the observations by the first two principal components (PC1 coordinate in x-axis, PC2 coordinate in y-axis)* 


```{r}
str(human)
human$GNI <- as.numeric(as.character(human$GNI))
human$Mat.Mor<- as.numeric(as.character(human$Mat.Mor))
library(corrplot)
human_std <- scale(human)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
